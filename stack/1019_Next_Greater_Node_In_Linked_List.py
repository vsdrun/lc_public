"""
https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-node-in-linked-list/

We are given a linked list with head as the first node.
Let's number the nodes in the list: node_1, node_2, node_3, ... etc.

Each node may have a next larger value:
for node_i, next_larger(node_i) is the node_j.val such that
j > i, node_j.val > node_i.val, and j is the smallest possible choice.
If such a j does not exist, the next larger value is 0.

Return an array of integers answer, where answer[i] = next_larger(node_{i+1}).

Note that in the example inputs (not outputs) below,
arrays such as [2,1,5] represent the serialization of a linked list with a
head node value of 2, second node value of 1, and third node value of 5.


Example 1:
Input: [2,1,5]
Output: [5,5,0]

Example 2:
Input: [2,7,4,3,5]
Output: [7,0,5,5,0]

Example 3:
Input: [1,7,5,1,9,2,5,1]
Output: [7,9,9,9,0,5,0,0]


Note:
1 <= node.val <= 10^9 for each node in the linked list.
The given list has length in the range [0, 10000].

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/description/

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one
more letter at a random position.

t = rnd(s) + char in random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

ç”¨ set?

Example:
Input:
s = "a"
t = "aa"

Output:
a

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
